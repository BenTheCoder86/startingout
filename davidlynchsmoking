<p>We all know and love David Lynch. He's a creative genius responsible for some of the great TV and films entries of our time. He's also a very stylish man, from his hair to the way he smokes his cigarettes.</p>
<p>My question to you, is which do you prefer? A smoking David Lynch or a non-smoking David Lynch? You can take your pick from the two photographs below to see where your choices will take you!</p>

<p>Blah blah blah you know David, we know David, the game is to work out if he is gonna smoke todya or not. Waddaya think?</p>
<p>Basically if you click the image of him smoking below it should take you to a video of him chatting about smoking</p>
<p>But if you click the second picture, it should take you to a video of him chatting about not smoking (just pretend, not really him)</p>
<p id="disclaimer-header">DISCLAIMER - I am not Lynch. I do not condone smoking. Perhaps he does, I don't. Smoke carefully all (if you decide to smoke at all!).</p>
